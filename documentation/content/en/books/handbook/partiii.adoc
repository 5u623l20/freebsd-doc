[[system-administration]]
= System Administration

The remaining chapters cover all aspects of FreeBSD system administration.
Each chapter starts by describing what will be learned as a result of reading the chapter,
and also details what the reader is expected to know before tackling the material.

These chapters are designed to be read as the information is needed.
They do not need to be read in any particular order, nor must all of them be read before beginning to use FreeBSD.
