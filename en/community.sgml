	and several <a href="&base;/community/newsgroups.html">newsgroups</a> available.
	There are a number of FreeBSD <a href="&base;/usergroups.html">User Groups</a> around the world,
	and there is also an active <a
        href="&base;/community/irc.html">IRC</a> community.  Many
        developers also maintain <a
        href="http://planet.freebsdish.org">blogs</a> about their FreeBSD
