    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This report covers FreeBSD related projects between April and
    September 2009.  During that time a lot of work has been done on
    wide variety of projects, including the Google Summer of Code
    projects. The BSDCan and EuroBSDCon conferences were held in Ottawa,
    CA, and Cambridge, UK which were both very successful.
    A new major version of FreeBSD, 8.0 is to be released soon.
    If you are wondering what's new in this long awaited release, read
    Ivan Voras' excellent <a
    href="http://ivoras.sharanet.org/freebsd/freebsd8.html">summary</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you
    enjoy the reading.</p>

    <p>Please note that the next deadline for submissions covering
    reports between October and December 2009 is January 15th,
    2011.</p>

    <body>
      <p>libnetstat(3) provides a user-space library API to monitor
        networking functions with the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ABI-robust interface making use of accessor functions in
  	  order to divorce monitoring applications from kernel or user ABI
	  changes.</li>

        <li>Supports running 32-bit monitoring tools on top of a 64-bit
	  kernel.</li>

        <li>Improved consistency for both kvm(3) and sysctl(3) when
	  retrieving information.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The supported abstractions are as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Active sockets and socket buffers.</li>
        <li>Network interfaces and multicast interfaces.</li>
        <li>mbuf(9) statistics.</li>
        <li>bpf(4) statistics.</li>
        <li>Routing statistics, routing tables, multicast routing.</li>
        <li>Protocol-dependent statistics.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is a sample application, called nettop(8), which provides a
        simple ncurses-based top(1)-like interface for monitoring active
        connections and network buffer allocations via the library.  A
        modified version of netstat(1) has also been created to use
        libnetstat(3) as much as possible.</p>

      <p>Pefs is a kernel level filesystem for transparently encrypting
      files on top of other filesystems (like zfs or ufs). It adds no
      extra information into files (unlike others), doesn't require
      cipher block sized io operations, supports per directory/file keys
      and key chaining, uses unique per file tweak for encryption.
      Supported algorithms: AES, Camellia, Salsa20. The code is ready for
      testing.</p>

      <p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework
      and applications to the FreeBSD operating system.</p>

      <p>During the past year, the BSD# Team continued to track the Mono
      development and the lang/mono port have almost always been
      up-to-date (we however had to skip mono-2.2 because of some
      regression issues in this release). Most of our patches have been
      merged in the mono trunk upstream, and should be included in the
      upcoming mono-2.6 release.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, a few more .NET related ports have been updated
      or added to the FreeBSD ports tree. These ports include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>www/xsp and www/mod_mono that make it possible to use FreeBSD
        for hosting ASP.NET application;</li>

        <li>lang/boo, a CLI-targeted programming language similar to
        Python;</li>

      <p>Some time ago I started writing a new driver for the FreeBSD
      kernel called vt(4), which is basically a replacement for Syscons.
      There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, but it is
      probably useful to mention what it does (and what not).</p>

      <p>Right now there are just two graphics drivers for vt(4), namely
      a VGA driver for i386 and amd64 and a Microsoft Xbox graphics
      driver (because it was so easy to write). I still have to figure
      out what I am going to do with VESA, because maybe it is better to
      just ignore VESA and figure out how hard it is to extend DRM to
      interact with vt(4).</p>

      <p>Some random features: it already supports both Unicode (UTF-8)
      input and output, it is MPSAFE and supports per-window graphical
      fonts of variable dimensions, containing an almost infinite amount
      of glyphs (both bold and regular).</p>

      <task>Syscons should already be migrated to TERM=xterm to make

      <p>The clang@FreeBSD team presents the status of clang/llvm being
      able to compile FreeBSD system. The situation as of today (early
      October) is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>i386 - kernel boots, world needs little hacks but works</li>

        <li>amd64 - kernel boots, world needs little hacks but works</li>

        <li>ppc - broken because of unknown RTLD bug</li>

        <li>other - unknown</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All other platforms are untested.</p>

      <p>A lot has happened over the spring/summer - amd64 got proper
      mcmodel=kernel support, compiler-rt was introduced (paving the way
      for libgcc replacement), we ran two experimental ports build to see
      how clang does there, C++ support is able to parse devd.cc without
      warnings, we got kernel working with -O2, we promoted FreeBSD to be
      officially supported plaform in LLVM, many parts of FreeBSD sources
      that we could not compile before we can compile now etc.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>ClangBSD branch of FreeBSD got a little stale and has not
      been updated for a while. We also need to get some important fixes
      into LLVM to get libc compiling and some other smaller issues. We
      can still appreciate more testers on minor platforms (arm, ppc and

      www/de and doc/de_DE.ISO8859-1 trees under the mentorship of Johann
      Kois. Since then, he has been working primarily on the Handbook, updating
      existing chapters and translating new ones. Most notably, the
      filesystems and DTrace chapters have been recently translated. Bugs found
      in the original documents along the way were reported back so that
      the other translation teams could incorporate them, as well.</p>

      <p>Christoph Sold has put his time in translating the wiki pages of
      the BSD Certification Group into the German language. This is a
      great help for German people, who want to take the exam and like to read

      Alberto has been our key contributor updating and testing Qt
      4.6.0-tp1. Raphael is a KDE developer, who has become our Gitorious
      liaison, he has been responsible for getting FreeBSD Qt patches
      merged in upstream.</p>

      <p>Markus Br&uuml;ffer (markus@) spent a lot of time patching widgets

      <p>Since their public launch in November 2008, the FreeBSD Forums
      (the most recent addition to the user community and support
      channels for the FreeBSD Operating System), have witnessed a
      healthy and steady growth.</p>

      <p>The user population is now at over 8,000 registered users, who
      have participated in over 6,000 topics, containing over 40,000
      posts in total. The sign-up rate hovers between 50-100 each week.
      The total number of visitors (including 'guests') is hard to gauge
      but is likely to be a substantial multiple of the registered
      userbase.</p>

      <p>New topics and posts are actively 'pushed out' to search
      engines. This in turn makes the Forums show up in search results
      more and more often, making it a valuable and very accessible
      source of information for the FreeBSD community.</p>

      <p>One of the contributing factors to the Forum's success is its
      'BSD-style' approach when it comes to administration and
      moderation. The Forums have a strong and unified identity, they are
      neatly divided into sub-forums (like 'Networking', 'Installing
      &amp; Upgrading', etc.), very actively moderated, spam-free, and
      with a core group of very active and helpful members, dispensing
      many combined decades' worth of knowledge to starting, intermediate
      and professional users of FreeBSD.</p>

      <p>We expect the Forums te be, and to remain, a central hub in
      FreeBSD's community and support efforts.</p>

      <p>Problem: Over the years the FreeBSD locale database
      (share/colldef, share/monetdef, share/msgdef, share/numericdef,
      share/timedef) has accumulated a total of 165 definitions (language
      - country-code - character-set triplets). The contents of the files
      is for Western European languages often low-ASCII but for Eastern
      European and Asian languages partly or fully high-ASCII. Without
      knowing how to display or interpret the character-sets, it is
      difficult to make sure by the general audience that the local
      languages (language - country-code) definitions is displayed
      properly in various character-sets. Suggested approach: With the
      combination of the data in the Unicode project (which goal is to
      define all the possible written characters and symbols on this
      planet) and the Common Locale Data Repository (which goal is to
      document all the different data and definitions needed for the
      locale database), we can easily keep track of the data, without the
      need of being able to display the data in the required
      charactersets or understand them fully when updates are submitted
      by third parties. Current status: Conversion of share/monetdef,
      share/msgdef, share/numericdef, share/timedef to the new design is
      completed. The Makefile infrastructure is converted. Regression
      checks are done. Most of the tools are in place, waiting on the
      import of bsdiconv to the base system.</p>

      imported we will be able to clean install from the definitions in

      <p>This project was started as part of Google Summer of Code 2008 but
	there is still an ongoing work to complete some missing parts.
	The BSD-licensed grep implementation is feature-complete and
	has a good level of GNU compatibility.  The only concern is the
	performance.  The GNU variant is much more complex, has about
	8 KSLOC, while BSD grep is tiny, has only 1.5 KSLOC.  GNU uses
	some shortcuts and optimizations to trick out the regex library,
	that is why it is significantly faster.  My point of view is that
	such optimizations must be implemented in the regex library,
	keeping the dependent utilities clean and easy to read.  BSD
	grep is so tiny that there is hardly any optimization opportunity
	by simplifying the code, so the regex library is the next important
	TODO.  There is another issue with the current regex library.
	It does not support some invalid regular expressions, which work
	in GNU.  We need to maintain compatibility, so we cannot just drop
	this feature.  Actually, BSD grep is linked to the GNU regex library
	to maintain this feature but due to the lack of the mentioned
	shortcuts, it is still slower than GNU.  Anyway, if we can live
	with this little performance hit until we get a modern regex library,
	I think grep is ready to enter HEAD.  As for the regex library,
	NetBSD's result of the last SoC is worth taking a look.</p>

      <p>The sort utility has been rewritten from scratch.  The existing
	BSD-licensed implementation could not deal with wide characters
	by design.  The new implementation is still lacking some features
	but is quite complete.  There is a performance issue, though.
	Sorting is a typical algorithmic subject but I am not an algorithmic
	expert, so my implementation is not completely optimal.  Some help
	would be welcome with this part.</p>

      <p>The bc/dc utilities have been ported from OpenBSD.  They pass
	OpenBSD's and GNU's regression tests but they arrived too late to
	catch 8.X, so they will go to HEAD after the release.</p>
