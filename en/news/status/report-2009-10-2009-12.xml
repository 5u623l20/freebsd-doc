    <title>Introduction</title>

    <p>This report covers &os; related projects between October and
    December 2009. Obviously, this is the last report in the year 2009,
    which has shown to be very important for the &os; Project. Besides
    other remarkable things, a new major version of &os;, 8.0, has been
    released, while the release process for 7.3 is soon to begin.</p>

    <p>Thanks to all the reporters for the excellent work! We hope you
    enjoy the reading. Let us also use this opportunity to wish you all
    happy and successfull new year 2010.</p>

    <p>Please note that the next deadline for submissions covering the
    period between January and March 2010 is April 15th, 2010.</p>

      <p>Existing ata(4) infrastructure which has been around many years
      has number of problems and limitations, in respect to modern
      controllers/devices support. A CAM subsystem (used for SCSI), which
      is around for almost the same time, implements many of required
      algorithms solving many problems in a better way. To reduce code
      duplication and better support border cases such as ATAPI and SAS,
      new CAM based ATA implementation has been started in order to use
      its benefits.</p>

      <p>As such, CAM infrastructure was extended to support different
      transports. New transport was implemented to support PATA/SATA
      buses. To support ATA disks, new CAM driver ada was written. ATAPI
      devices are supported by existing SCSI drivers cd, da, sa, etc. To
      support SATA port-multipliers new CAM driver pmp was written. To
      support most featured and widespread SATA controllers, new drivers
      ahci(4) and siis(4) were developed.</p>

      <p>To support legacy ATA controllers, kernel option ATA_CAM was
      added. When used, it makes all ata(4) controllers directly
      available to CAM, deprecating ata(4) periperal drivers and external
      APIs. To make it possible, ata(4) code was heavily refactored,
      making controller driver API more strict.</p>

      <p>Command queuing support gives new ATA implementation up to
      double performance benefit on some workloads, whereas 20-30% is
      quite usual.</p>

      <p>SATA Port Multipliers support makes it easy to build fast and
      cheap storages with huge capacities, by using dozens of SATA drives
      in one system or external enclosures,</p>

      <p>Some of that code was presented in &os; 8.0-RELEASE, but
      8-STABLE includes much improved version now.</p>

      <p>Chromium is a Webkit-based web browser that is largely BSD
      licensed. We ported it from linux to &os; in October and have been
      posting patches and test builds periodically ever since. Chromium
      works well on &os; &mdash; it is very fast and stable, but there
      are a handful of rough edges that need to be polished up. Two
      remaining bugs should probably be fixed before releasing a
      chromium-devel port. We are looking for volunteers to test and
      maintain this port, to make this BSD browser a viable option on the
      &os; desktop.</p>

    <title>SUJ: Journaled Softupdates</title>

      <p>I have been adding a small intent log to softupdates to
      eliminate the requirement for fsck after an unclean shutdown. This
      work has been funded by Yahoo!, iXsystems, and Juniper. Kirk
      McKusick has been aiding me with design critiques and helping me
      better understand softupdates.</p>

      <p>Extensive testing by myself and Peter Holm has yielded a stable
      patch. Current users are encouraged to follow the instructions
      posted to current@ to verify stability in your own workloads.
      Updates are forthcoming and it is expected to be merged with
      current before the end of January. Ports to older versions of &os;
      will be available in SVN under alternate branches. Official
      backports will be decided by re@ when current is stable.</p>

      <p>The changes are fully backwards and forwards compatible as there
      are very few metadata changes to the filesystem. The journal may be
      enabled or disabled on existing ffs filesystems using tunefs(8).
      The log consumes 64 megabytes of space at maximum and fsck time is
      bounded by the size of the log rather than the size of the
      filesystem. Other details are available in my technical
      journal.</p>

      <p>Most of the recent activity was dealing with the 8.0 release
      process. As an experiment, we tried to decouple the ports QA
      timeline as much as possible from the src QA timeline. Although
      this meant that the impact on people actively maintaining and using
      ports was much less than in previous releases, it still has not
      solved the problem of the release going out with an stale set of
      packages. We are still trying to come up with a better solution for
      the problem.</p>

      <p>The ports count is over 21,000. The PR count jumped to over
      1000, but is now back to around 950.</p>

      <p>We are currently building packages for amd64-6, amd64-7,
      amd64-8, i386-6, i386-7, i386-8, i386-9, ia64-8, sparc64-7, and
      sparc64-8. This represents the addition of i386-9 and ia64-8 since
      the last report.</p>

      <p>There has been some discussion of when to drop regular package
      builds for 6.x, but no decision has been made yet. The cluster, and
      the portmgrs, are struggling to keep up with so many branches being
      active all at the same time.</p>

      <p>Mark Linimon continues to make progress on the cluster nodes.
      Almost every node that does not have a hard disk failure is now
      online. In addition, he continues to make progress debugging
      problems that occasionally take nodes offline.</p>

      <p>The next task is to characterize the overall performance of the
      build cluster. The question has been asked of us, "what would it
      take to speed up package builds?" There is no one simple answer. It
      is not merely a matter of having a larger number of package
      building machines -- before asking for funding we first need to
      identify the current bottlenecks. While we are starting to
      understand the problems on the nodes, the problems on the dispatch
      machine itself are much harder. Complicating the matter is that
      there are several periodic processes (ZFS backup, ZFS expiration,
      and errorlog compression, among others) that can combine to slow
      that machine significantly. The interaction of all these
      simultaneously is proving difficult to quantify.</p>

      <p>Between pav and miwi, many more experimental ports runs have
      been completed and committed.</p>

      <p>We have added 3 new committers since the last report, and 1
      older one has rejoined.</p>
    </body>

    <help>
      <task>We are still trying to set up ports tinderboxes that can be
      made available to committers for pre-testing.</task>

      <task>Most of the remaining ports PRs are "existing port/PR
      assigned to committer". Although the maintainer-timeout policy is
      helping to keep the backlog down, we are going to need to do more
      to get the ports in the shape they really need to be in.</task>

      <task>Although we have added many maintainers, we still have more
      than 4,700 unmaintained ports (see, for instance, the list on
      portsmon). (The percentage remains steady at just over 22%.) We are
      always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few
      unmaintained ports. As well, the packages on amd64 and especially
      sparc64 lag behind i386, and we need more testers for those.</task>

      <p>The main thing that has taken place since the last Status Report
      is that I have gotten to the bottom of the remaining PCI problems
      with Sun Fire V215/V245 and support for these has been completed
      and since r202023 now is part of HEAD. With some luck it will also
      be part of the upcoming 7.3-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>In other news:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Two bugs in the NFS server causing unaligned accesses and
        thus panics on sparc64 and all other architectures with strict
        alignment requirements (basically all Tier 2 ones) have been
        fixed. There likely will be a 8.0-RELEASE Erratum Notice released
        for these.</li>

        <li>&os; has been adopted to the changed firmware of newer Sun
        Fire V480 (those equipped with version 7 Schizo bridges) and was
        reported to now run fine on these. The necessary change will be
        part of 7.3-RELEASE. Unfortunately, using the on-board NICs in
        older models of Sun Fire V480 (at least those equipped with
        version 4 Schizo bridges) under &os; still leads to the firmware
        issuing a FATAL RESET due to what appears to be a CPU bug which
        needs to be worked around.</li>

        <li>Work on supporting Sun Fire V1280 has been started but still
        is in very early stages. Unfortunately, these are rather quirky
        machines. After solving two firmware specialties the loader now
        is able to boot the kernel but the latter currently still fails
        in early cycles as trying to take the trap table over from the
        firmware results in a solid hang.</li>

      <p>Recently a bunch of new device IDs have been added for the
      u3g(4) cellular wireless driver, the list should be comparable with
      other operating systems around. A lot of these devices have a
      feature where the unit first attaches as a disk or cdrom that
      contains the Win/Mac drivers, this state should be detected by the
      u3g driver and the usb device is sent a command to switch to modem
      mode. This has been working for quite some time but as its
      implemented differently for each vendor I am looking for feedback
      on any units where the auto switchover is not working (or the init
      is not recognized at all). Please ensure you are running an up to
      date kernel from head r201681 or later, or stable/8 if r201681 has

      <p>Since the last report we have seen a growth of 2000 users on our
      Forums resulting in ca. 10.000 registered users at this time. The
      posts count is about to reach 60.000 soon, which are contained in
      almost 9000 threads.</p>

      <p>The sign-up rate still hovers between 50-100 each week. The
      total number of visitors (including 'guests') is currently hard to
      gauge, but is likely to be a substantial multiple of the registered
      userbase.</p>

      <p>New topics and posts are actively 'pushed out' to search
      engines. This in turn makes the Forums show up in search results
      more and more often, making it a valuable and very accessible
      source of information for the &os; community.</p>

      <p>One of the contributing factors to the Forums' success is their
      'BSD-style' approach when it comes to administration and
      moderation. The Forums have a strong and unified identity and are
      very actively moderated, spam-free, and with a core group of very
      active and helpful members, dispensing many combined decades' worth
      of knowledge to starting, intermediate and professional users of

      <p>V4L video support in the Linux emulator is now available.</p>

      <p>This work allows Linux applications using V4L video calls to
      work with existing &os; video drivers that provide V4L interfaces.
      It is tested and working with the net/skype port and also with
      browser-based Flash apps that access webcams. It is tested on
      &os;-8.0/amd64 and &os;-7.2/i386. An early version has been
      committed to head and work is in progress to commit the latest
      version and then MFC.</p>

      <p>Note: to be clear, this does not add V4L support to all webcams.
      The &os; camera driver must already offer V4L support itself in
      order for a Linux app to be able to use that camera. The
      multimedia/pwcbsd port provides the pwc(4) driver that already has
      V4L support. If your camera is supported by a different driver, you
      will need to enhance that driver to add V4L support.</p>

      <p>Historically, FreeBSD has limited the number of supplemental
	groups per process to 15 (NGROUPS_MAX was incorrectly declared to be
	16).  In FreeBSD 8.0 we raised the limit to 1023, which should be
	sufficient for most users and will be acceptably efficient for
	incorrectly written applications that statically allocate
	NGROUPS_MAX + 1 entries.</p>

      <p>Because some systems such as Linux 2.6 support a larger
	group limit, we have further relaxed this restriction in -CURRENT and
	made kern.ngroups a tunable value, which supports values between 1023
	and INT_MAX - 1.  We plan to merge this to 8-STABLE before
	8.1-RELEASE.</p>

      <p>The base/projects/mips branch has been merged into base/head.
      The merge is complete and the sanity tests have passed. The code
      has booted on both a Ubiquiti RouterStation (big endian) as well as
      in gxemul (little endian).</p>

      <p>The branch lived for one year, minus a day, and accumulated much
      work:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A new port to the Atheros AR71xx series of processors. This
        port supports the RouterStation and RouterStation PRO boards from
        Ubiquiti. Other boards should work with minimal tweaking. This
        port should be considered as nearing production quality, and has
        been used extensively by the developers. The primary author of
        this port is Oleksandr Tymoshenko (gonzo@FreeBSD.org).</li>

        <li>A new port to the sibyte BCM1250 SoC on the BCM91250
        evaluation board (aka SWARM). This port is reported to be stable,
        but this hardware is a little old and not widely available. The
        primary author of this port is Neel Natu (neel@FreeBSD.org). Only
        one core is presently supported.</li>

        <li>A port, donated by Cavium, to their Octeon and Octeon plus
        series of SoC (CN3xxx and CN5xxx). This code is preliminary,
        supporting only a single core right now. It has been lightly
        tested on the CN3860 evaluation board only in 32-bit mode. Warner
        Losh (imp@FreeBSD.org) has been driving the efforts to get this
        code into the tree.</li>

        <li>A port, donated by RMI, to their XLR series of SoCs. This
        port is single core only as well. The code reaches multi-user but
        should be considered beta quality for the moment. Randal Stewart
        (rrs@FreeBSD.org) has been driving the efforts to integrate this
        into the tree.</li>

        <li>Preliminary support for building a mips64 kernel from this
        source base. More work is needed here, but at least two kernels
        successfully build in 64-bit mode (OCTEON1 and MALTA64).</li>

        <li>Very early support for N32 and N64 ABIs</li>

        <li>Support for booting compressed kernels has been added
        (gonzo@).</li>

        <li>Improved support for debugging</li>

        <li>Improved busdma and bus_space support</li>

        <li>Many bug fixes</li>

        <li>More types of MIPS cores are recognized</li>

        <li>Expanded cache handling for newer processors</li>

        <li>Beginning of a port to the alchemy au1XXX cpus is present,
        but experimental.</li>

        <li>Work on SMP is underway to support multicore processors like
        the sibyte, Octeon and XLR processors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I am sure there are minor items I have forgotten. If so, please
      forgive any omission on my part...</p>

      <p>he branch had been updated incorrectly several times over the
      past year, and the damage was too much to repair. We've retired the
      branch and will do further mips development in "head" for the time
      being. If you have a checked out tree, the suggested way to update
      the projects/mips tree you have is to do a "svn switch
      svn://svn.freebsd.org/base/head" in that tree.</p>

      <p>I would like to thank everybody that has contributed time, code
      or hardware to make FreeBSD/mips better.</p>

      <p>As development proceeds, I will keep posting updates. In
      addition, I hope to have some mini "how-to" wiki pages done for
      people that want to try it out.</p>

	Flattened Device Tree (FDT) technology, the mechanism for describing
	computer hardware resources, which cannot be probed or self enumerated, in
	a uniform and portable way. The primary consumer of this technology are
	embedded FreeBSD platforms (ARM, AVR32, MIPS, PowerPC), where a lot of
	designs are based on similar chips, but have different assignment of pins,
	memory layout, addresses bindings, interrupts routing and other resources.</p>

      <p>HAST software will provide synchronous replication of any GEOM
      provider (eg. disk, partition, mirror, etc.) or file from one &os;
      machine (primary node) to another one (secondary node). 
      <br />

      Because data is replicated on block level neither application, no
      file systems have to be modified to take advantage of this
      functionality. 
      <br />

      The functionality that HAST software will provide is very similar
      to the functionality provided by the DRBD project for Linux. 
      <br />

      The HAST project is sponsored by the &os; Foundation. 
      <br />

      Work is progressing well, first milestone was reached in December
      2009 and the project completion date is January 31st 2010. 
      <br />

      Check out &os; mailing lists for patches to test in February and
      wish me good luck! 
      <br />

      And BTW, don't forget to donate to the &os; Foundation, as your

      <p>On January 13 I removed the utmp user accounting database and
	replaced it by POSIX utmpx. Unfortunately the upgrade path is a bit
	bumpy, because the utmp interface provided almost no library
	interface to interact with the database files.</p>

      <p>This change may have caused some regressions. Some ports may fail
	to build, while there could also be bugs in the library
	functions.</p>

      <p>Good compatibility has been ensured and there are only few pending
	items, which have to be reviewed/enhanced.  Recently, an enhacement
	has been completed, which makes it possible to accomplish better
	transliteration, just like in the GNU version.  An initial testing
	patch is expected at the beginning of February.</p>

      <p>As 8.0-RELEASE is out, BSD bc/dc can be now committed, we are
	only waiting for the portbuild exp-run to make sure there are no
	regressions after this change.  BSD grep is stalled because of
	some regex library issues.  We need first a fast and modern regex
	library so that we can change to BSD grep.  BSD sort has few
	incomplete features and needs some performance review.</p>
