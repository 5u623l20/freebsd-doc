<p>While still many people use RELENG_4, it is End of Life (EOL) and
    End of Support (EOS).  We encourage all users and developers to
    migrate to the FreeBSD 6.X branch, which is a stable and mature
    platform, and is now the 'reference' FreeBSD branch for the Ports
    Collection.  The "last known good" tree has been tagged with the
    <tt>RELEASE_4_EOL</tt> tag as a convenience to those remaining
    users who intend to self-support their own 4.X installations.
    This tag is not supported in any way and security fixes will not
    be applied.  Usage is therefore highly discouraged and should only
    be used as a last resort.</p>

<p>Support for RELENG_4 was removed from the ports infrastructure
    after the <tt>RELENG_4_EOL</tt> tag and the ports collection can no
    longer be used on that branch.  Therefore maintainers are also no
    longer required to provide any form of support for running their
    ports on FreeBSD 4.X, and may also remove any legacy support code
    at their convenience.</p>
