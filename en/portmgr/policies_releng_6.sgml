<p>While many people still use RELENG_6, it is End of Life (EOL) and
    End of Support (EOS).  We encourage all users and developers to
    migrate to the FreeBSD 7.X or 8.x branch, both of which is a mature
    and stable platform, and is now the 'reference' FreeBSD branch for
    the Ports Collection.  The "last known good" tree will be tagged
    with the <tt>RELEASE_6_EOL</tt> tag as a convenience to those
    remaining users who intend to self-support their own 6.X
    installations.  This tag is not supported in any way and security
    fixes will not be applied.  Usage is therefore highly discouraged
    and should only be used as a last resort.</p>

<p>Support for RELENG_6 will be removed from the ports infrastructure
    after the <tt>RELENG_6_EOL</tt> tag and the ports collection can no
    longer be used on that branch.  Therefore maintainers are also no
    longer required to provide any form of support for running their
    ports on FreeBSD 6.X, and may also remove any legacy support code
    at their convenience.</p>
